# Functions/Methods play an important role in any language
# They are the small blocks in a code that actually enable us to write a robust code
# Thus, pay HARD AND WELL ATTENTION WHILE LEARNING FUNCTIONS

'''
IN JAVA WE HAVE SEEN FUNCTIONS ARE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:-

private static void newFunction()
{
}

public boolean isTrueFunction(String response)
{
}
