# MODULE:- A File containing python codes in it. May have functions or other classes(similar to java packages and all)
# Helps break the code into several small bits and use the ones that are often needed

import moduleSide as kol            # writing 'as kol' means it is equivalent to the object name

# below I will be calling the functions from that other file
kol.hello()
print("\n")
kol.hello2()

'''
THERE IS ANOTHER METHOD FOR IMPORTHING, THAT IS:-
from moduleSide import *
'''

# to know more about IN-BUILT MODULES, type this once:-  help('modules')
